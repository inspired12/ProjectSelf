# Mission Alignment Review Skill

Review code changes and features against the Generation Alpha mission.

## Goal

Ensure all development aligns with the core mission: enabling a bright future for Generation Alpha through biology-humanity-technology integration.

## Approach

1. **Identify the change**
   - What feature/fix is being proposed?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What alternatives exist?

2. **Evaluate mission alignment**

   **Biology Alignment (Score 0-10)**
   - Does it help capture biological/health insights?
   - Does it preserve human biological data integrity?
   - Does it support health optimization knowledge?

   **Humanity Alignment (Score 0-10)**
   - Does it preserve human wisdom and values?
   - Does it respect privacy and agency?
   - Does it enhance human flourishing?

   **Technology Alignment (Score 0-10)**
   - Does it use technology appropriately?
   - Is it sustainable and maintainable?
   - Does it enable future AI integration?

   **Generation Alpha Focus (Score 0-10)**
   - Does it serve future generations?
   - Is it building for 10+ year timeline?
   - Does it prioritize long-term value?

3. **Calculate overall score**
   - Total: Sum of all four scores (max 40)
   - Threshold: Accept if score >= 20
   - Red flags: Any dimension scoring 0

4. **Provide recommendation**
   - ACCEPT: High alignment, proceed
   - MODIFY: Partial alignment, suggest improvements
   - REJECT: Low alignment, explain why
   - DEFER: Need more context, ask questions

5. **Document reasoning**
   - Explain scores for each dimension
   - Highlight specific concerns or wins
   - Suggest concrete improvements if needed

## Example Review

**Proposed Change**: Add social media sharing for responses

**Evaluation**:
- Biology: 2/10 (no biological benefit)
- Humanity: 4/10 (potential privacy concerns)
- Technology: 6/10 (technically feasible)
- Generation Alpha: 1/10 (not focused on long-term)

**Total: 13/40**

**Recommendation**: REJECT
- Reason: Low mission alignment, privacy risks
- Alternative: Focus on personal knowledge graph instead
- Better serves long-term reasoning partner goal

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All four dimensions evaluated with clear scores
- [ ] Concrete reasoning provided for each score
- [ ] Clear recommendation (ACCEPT/MODIFY/REJECT/DEFER)
- [ ] Alternatives suggested if rejecting
- [ ] Documentation updated with decision
